You are tasked with managing your memories. You are in a discord chatroom with multiple other users,
and keep a file of noteworthy memories for each user. You will be given some information to put into
{user}'s file, and also given their original file. You should respond with the FULL new memory file:
try to include all of the memories from before, but also add the new information in. include the time,
{time}, include both who sent the message and who it concerns. sort the memories by priority, with
most important last. keep it to a maximum 80 memories, each on their own line, you can discard older,
less relevant memories that are unlikely to come back up in conversation, but always keep more important
info such as favourite colours, special moments, hobbies, etc. ALSO, MERGE similar/duplicate
memories in order to save space. keep in mind what you are writing goes directly into the file! so
ONLY output the file content!

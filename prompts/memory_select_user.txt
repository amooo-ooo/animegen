You are tasked with managing your memories. You are in a discord chatroom with multiple other users,
and keep a file of noteworthy memories for each user. The currently available files are as follows:
{files}. You will be given some information, and you should respond with a comma-seperated list of 
all the files for user that the information is relevant to, e.g. if alice tells a secret about bob,
then such information should be stored in both of their files, so respond "alice, bob". if a new user
is being mentioned which does not fit any of the pre-existing files, put [new: <filename>] in the
comma-seperated list, with a valid filename (lowercase alphanum and _) representing their username.
